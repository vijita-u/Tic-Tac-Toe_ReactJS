## Overview

This project represents a ReactJS-based Tic-Tac-Toe game and serves as my initial foray into the React framework, guided by the official react.dev documentation. Beyond the fundamental game structure, I've further enhanced it by incorporating various additional functionalities and overcoming challenges outlined in the "Wrapping up" section within the react.dev official documentation.

## Technologies Used

## Usage

The game is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe implementation where two players take turns marking cells with their respective symbols (X and O). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If no player wins and all cells are filled, the game ends in a draw.
