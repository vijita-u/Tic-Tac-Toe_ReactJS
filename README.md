## Overview

This project represents a ReactJS-based Tic-Tac-Toe game and serves as my initial foray into the React framework, guided by the official react.dev documentation. Beyond the fundamental game structure, I've further enhanced it by incorporating various additional functionalities and overcoming challenges outlined in the "Wrapping up" section within the react.dev official documentation.

## Technologies Used

1. ReactJS
2. CSS
3. JS

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone this repository:

```

### 2. Install the project dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server:
```bash
  npm start
```

## Usage

The game is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe implementation where two players take turns marking cells with their respective symbols (X and O). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If no player wins and all cells are filled, the game ends in a draw.

## Additional Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game is responsive and can be played on various screen sizes.
- **Winning Highlight**: When a player wins, the three squares that caused the win are highlighted.
- When no one wins and the game ends in a draw, a message is displayed to indicate the result.

## Exta Challenges undertaken

Among the additional challenges suggested on the [react.dev](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) website, the following were successfully completed to further enhance my React skills:

1. For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
2. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
3. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to express my gratitude to the React Team for providing exceptional [React Documentation](https://react.dev/), serving as an excellent resource for individuals who are new to React and programming as a whole.
